% After you get hexi_int, do calc_diff(vols_active, vols_passive) where
% vols_active and vols_passive are nx2 matrices (n = # of digits in
% hexi_int, aka number of subjects). How to construct vols_active and
% vols_passive? we need permute_vols to assign labels for each subject
% based on hexi_int. right now, permute_vols spits out a 6x1 vector. we
% just need to modify it to output C_extens, not diff_matrix. Then we have
% a 6x4 matrix and we say the first two in the row are active and the second two are
% passive. The value of hexi_int could index that matrix to pick which permutation, 
% then we split so there's 2 1x2 matrices and concatenate all those across
% subjects to construct our vols_active and vols_passive which we then feed
% into calc_diff
