### Synopsis
Analyses of in-scanner motion in neuroimaging experiments have established that differences in motion between groups can cause bias and variance in morphometric measures calculated by widely-used software packages. Recent work has demonstrated that the use of the volumetric navigators (vNavs) prospective motion correction system improves the reproducibility of cortical morphometry measures. Here, vNav motion correction was applied to a mixed sample of Huntington’s Disease (HD) patients and healthy controls to test its ability to improve the quality of morphometric data. The results suggest that vNav motion correction reduces within-subject variation in morphometric measures relevant to HD and other neurodegenerative disorders.
